# Character Generator
## What is it?
This project is an old personal one for an old version of the site Realms of Hyrule for a previous in-house tabletop (Dungeons and Dragons inspired - Really more WoD but that's nitpicking) system that they used. It was my first 'Major' project and the first that wasn't in some way shape or form created for explicitly external (work or school) and it was my first time tackling some ideas that I had dabbled in, but never really went into (extensive ajax and database usage, integration with a third party software(Invision Power Board)). I had also only really started learning php/js in the spring of 2014. It was started sometime in the summer of 2014 and the last update was late January 2015 and I was told it was in use until mid 2016.

## But what does it do?
It facilitated the creation of characters in conjunction with an account on the site and after creation would integrate to pull limited information from the site. None of the information on it is live anymore, and I had a json file that was used to create all the original tables and populate with information as neccessary, but I can't seem to find them.

## This code is amateur and it's bad in all the following ways
Woah, hold on there buddy. Yeah I know it's trash and it's cringe worthy to look at, but it's still fairly expansive for my relative level of experience at the time (Read: None) And it's something.
